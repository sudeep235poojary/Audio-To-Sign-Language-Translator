# Audio-To-Sign-Language-Translator
This project is based on converting the audio signals received to text using speech to text api (python modules or google api) and then using the semantics of Natural Language Processing to breakdown the text into smaller understandable pieces which requires. Machine Learning as a part. Data sets of predefined sign language are used as the input so that the software can use artificial Intelligence to display the converted audio into the sign language.

- Front-end using EasyGui.
- Speech as input through microphone using PyAudio. 
- Speech recognition using Google Speech API.
- Text Preprocessing using NLP.
